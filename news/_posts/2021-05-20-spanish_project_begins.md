The first Spanish tutorial is live! Galaxy has always had google-translated tutorials, but we are now embarking on a project to assess the learning experience with human-translated, vs google-translated, bioinformatics tutorials. We are aiming to create a package of tutorials for single-cell analysis, in the first instance, and survey usage and utility in a workshop for native Spanish speakers. A big thanks to new contributors {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="pclo" %} and {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="ales-ibt" %} (EMBL-EBI), as well as GTN overlords {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="beatrizserrano" %} (University of Freiburg), {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="shiltemann" %} & {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="hexylena" %} (Erasmus-MC), for their hard work on this project from translation to sustainability, and, of course, {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="nomadscientist" %} (The Open University/EBI) for leading the project!
